### Exporting Your Workflow as a JSON File

To share your n8n workflow with others, export it as a JSON file:

### **Step 1: Open Your Workflow**

- Navigate to the workflow you want to export

### **Step 2: Download the JSON File**

- Click the "..." (three dots) menu button
- Select "Download" from the dropdown menu
- The workflow JSON file will be downloaded to your computer automatically

### **Step 3: Share Your Workflow**

- Share the downloaded JSON file with colleagues, team members, or the n8n community
- Recipients can import the file using the import steps outlined above

### Best Practices

- **Review before activating**: Always check imported workflows thoroughly before running them in production
- **Update credentials**: Remember to reconfigure all authentication and API credentials after importing
- **Test thoroughly**: Run test executions to verify the workflow operates as expected
- **Document your workflows**: Add notes within your workflow to help others understand its purpose and configuration
- **Organize your files**: Use descriptive file names when saving JSON exports (e.g., "customer-onboarding-workflow.json")
- **Version control**: Consider keeping multiple versions of your workflows as you make improvements

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If a workflow fails after import, check that all required nodes and integrations are available in your n8n instance
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and API access for third-party services used in the workflow
- Review the execution logs to identify any configuration issues

That's all there is to it! You can now easily import and export workflows in n8n, making it simple to share automation solutions and collaborate with others.
