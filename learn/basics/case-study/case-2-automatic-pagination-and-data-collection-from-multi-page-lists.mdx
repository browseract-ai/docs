## 1. Case Overview

This case demonstrates another high-frequency pattern in web automation: [******Using the Loop node to repeatedly turn pages and collect data in a multi-page list until a specific condition is met.******](/learn/basics/node-types/loop-node)

The core logic is as follows:

1. The AI opens a job listing page.
2. Inside a [**Loop**](/learn/basics/node-types/loop-node), it repeatedly executes: **Collect current page data → Turn to next page → Wait for new page to load**.
3. The Loop automatically decides when to stop based on your settings (e.g., "until 50 job postings are collected").
4. Finally, it exports all job information as structured data.

This case uses the "Customer Service Job List" from a remote work website as an example to demonstrate a complete "Multi-Page List Auto-Pagination + Batch Collection" workflow.

**Note:** This logic is equally applicable to any list page with a pagination bar (e.g., recruitment, e-commerce products, articles, event lists).

## 2. Detailed Steps

### 1. [Visit Page](/learn/basics/node-types/visit-node) (Open Job List)

- **Objective:** Open the target job list page directly, rather than navigating from the homepage.
- **Configuration:**
  - **URL:** Enter the list page address, e.g., `https://himalayas.app/jobs/customer-service`.
  - **Tab:** Select **Current Tab Access**.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task** (if this step fails, there is no point in continuing).

### 2. [Loop](/learn/basics/node-types/loop-node) (Cycle Control: Paginating until 50 items are collected)

- **Objective:** Repeat the entire set of actions "Collect Current Page → Next Page → Wait" until the condition you set is met: **Collect 50 job items** or reach the maximum number of cycles.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Check Timing:** Select **Before each cycle, check the stop condition**.
  - **Stop Condition:** Enter `Until 50 items are collected` in the input box. This means "stop when the number of collected items reaches 50."
  - **Max Duration number of cycles:** Enter `100` to limit the loop to a maximum of 100 rounds, preventing infinite loops in extreme cases.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Temporarily keep **Stop Task**. If a critical error occurs within the Loop, the task can be terminated immediately.

> **Explanation:** The Loop is the core of this workflow. You are telling the AI: "Run at most 100 laps, but you can stop once you have 50 job items."

### 3. [Extract Data](/learn/basics/node-types/extract-data-node) (Collect Current Page Info)

- **Note:** This node is a **child node** of the Loop, meaning it will execute once in every cycle.
- **Objective:** On the current page, copy information from all visible job cards (e.g., Job Title, Publish Date) and append it to the existing dataset.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Capture the page area range:** Select **Full Page** (convenient for scenarios where the whole page is a list).
  - **Data Field:** List the field names you want to collect, such as:
    - **Job Title**
    - **Publish Date**
  - **Filtering Criteria:** Leave unchecked (do not filter the list yet).
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task**, implying that if data cannot be collected, the task should stop.

> **Note:** Once this step is complete, the "number of collected items" will increase, giving meaning to the Loop condition `Until 50 items are collected`.

### 4. [Pagination](/learn/basics/node-types/pagination-node) (Turn to Next Page)

- **Note:** Also a child node of the Loop. After collecting one page, flip to the next.
- **Objective:** Find the pagination bar at the bottom of the page and click "Next" to enter the next page of the job list.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Next Page / Previous Page:** Select **Next Page**. This tells the Pagination node to specifically handle the "Next" button click.
  - **Element Selection:** Mark the "Next" button or the corresponding pagination element on the page.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task**.

![PixPin_2025-12-04_11-20-51.png](/images/PixPin_2025-12-04_11-20-51.png)

### 5. [Wait](/learn/basics/node-types/wait-node) (Wait for New Page Load)

- **Objective:** After clicking "Next Page," do not immediately resume collecting. Give the page some time to complete loading.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Wait:** Set to `3` seconds, for example.
  - **Tip:** For environments with unstable networks, consider increasing the wait time. In advanced usage, this can be replaced with "Wait for element to appear" for a smarter approach.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task**.

> **Reasoning:** Since the webpage may not load all information immediately, you need to tell the AI: "Wait a moment after turning the page, let the new job cards appear, and then extract."

### 6. Finish: Output Data (Export All Collected Jobs)

- **Objective:** When the Loop determines that "50 job items have been collected" or the maximum cycles are reached, unify and export all data collected from previous pages.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Output Format:** The current selection is **JSON**, which is suitable for subsequent program processing or secondary development. If you prefer a table, you can choose CSV.
  - **Output as a file:** Check this if you need to generate a local downloadable file. If unchecked, the structured result returns in the log.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task**.

## 3. Human Operation vs. AI Nodes

To better understand the workflow, compare how a human operates versus how the AI nodes are structured. You will see they follow the exact same logic.

| **Your Action (Human Operation)**                                                                | **Corresponding AI Node**                                              | **Function Description**                                                                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Open browser**, enter the job list URL.                                                        | [**Visit Page**](/learn/basics/node-types/visit-node)                  | Starts the task, landing immediately on Page 1 of the list.                                                               |
| **Set a goal:** Collect at least 50 jobs, or keep turning pages if not enough.                   | [**Loop**](/learn/basics/node-types/loop-node)                         | Sets the cycle rules and stop conditions (e.g., "Until 50 items are collected" or "Max 100 pages").                       |
| **Browse** the job cards on the current page, noting down the title and date.                    | [**Extract Data**](/learn/basics/node-types/extract-data-node)         | Batch scrapes fields (Job Title, Publish Date, etc.) from the current page and adds them to the dataset.                  |
| **Scroll down** to the bottom and click the "Next" button.                                       | [**Pagination**](/learn/basics/node-types/pagination-node) (Next Page) | Automatically clicks the "Next Page" element in the pagination bar to navigate.                                           |
| **Wait** for the new page of jobs to load.                                                       | [**Wait**](/learn/basics/node-types/wait-node)                         | Pauses to allow the page to stabilize and content to appear before the next collection round.                             |
| **Repeat:** "Record jobs → Click Next → Wait" until total jobs ≥ 50 or the last page is reached. | [**Loop**](/learn/basics/node-types/loop-node) (Execution)             | Executes the sequence _Extract Data → Pagination → Wait_ repeatedly, checking the stop condition before/after each round. |
| **Organize** all recorded job info into a structured list.                                       | **Finish: Output Data**                                                | Exports all data collected throughout the entire loop process into a single JSON/CSV file.                                |

### Summary

Whenever you encounter a **"Multi-Page List"** and your thought process is: "I want to turn pages one by one and copy the first N items," simply build the blocks following this Case 2 structure:

1. **Outer Layer:** Use [**Loop**](/learn/basics/node-types/loop-node) to control "Pagination + Conditional Stop".
2. **Inside Loop:** Place [**Extract Data**](/learn/basics/node-types/extract-data-node)\*\* → [****Pagination****](/learn/basics/node-types/pagination-node) → \*\*[**Wait**](/learn/basics/node-types/wait-node).
3. **Final Step:** Use **Finish** to export the results at once.
