sidebarTitle: "Case3: Load More & Infinite Scroll"
---

## 1. Case Overview

This case demonstrates a very frequent pattern in web automation: **Automatically loading more content in a long list and collecting data until a condition is met.**

Typical characteristics of this list type include:

- The page retains a single "Load More" button that appears continuously.
- Clicking it appends a batch of new content to the bottom of the same page.
- Alternatively, simply scrolling down triggers the automatic loading of more data, without a traditional pagination bar.

In this case, we focus exclusively on Long Lists:

Using the Crutchfield TV product list as an example, we will demonstrate how to use Loop List + Auto-click Load More to continuously expand the list, traverse each product, and collect data on the same page.

**Note:** This pattern applies to all multi-page lists that rely on "Load More / Infinite Scroll." As long as the page URL doesn't change and content is just appended downwards, you can use this logic.

## 2. Detailed Steps

### 1. [Visit Page](/learn/basics/node-types/visit-node) (Open TV Product List)

- **Objective:** Open the Crutchfield TV list page directly, avoiding the need to navigate step-by-step from the homepage.
- **Configuration:**
  - **URL:** `https://www.crutchfield.com/S-YkA30Gowvuu/shopsearch/TV.html?fa=1&pg=1` (You can replace this with any other category or search result page; the logic is identical).
  - **Tab:** Select **Current Tab Access**.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task** (if the list page cannot be accessed, there is no point in continuing).

### 2. [Loop List](/learn/basics/node-types/loop-list-node) (Traverse List + Auto-click Load More)

- **Core Logic:** This node is the heart of this pattern.
- **Objective:** Tell the AI: "This entire area is a product list. Please process items one by one. If a 'Load More' button appears at the bottom, click it automatically to load more products until the limit is reached or there is no more content."
- **Configuration:**
  - **List Region:** Select the entire list area containing the TV product cards on the page. Description example: `The main TV product list in the middle of the page.`
  - **Max items to focus:** Enter `10` (for example) to traverse at most the first 10 products.
  - **Load More / Auto-load:** Check the option **Auto-click "Load More" button when present to load more items**.
    - **Meaning:** When the Loop List detects a "Load More" button at the bottom, it will automatically click it, wait for new products to load, and then continue traversing.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task**.
  - **Note:** You do **not** need a separate "Pagination" node. The **Loop List** node handles both the traversal and the "Load More" clicking action automatically.

### 3. [Extract Data Item](/learn/basics/node-types/extract-data-item-node) (Scrape Fields for Each Product)

- **Important:** This node must be placed **inside** the **Loop List** node so that it executes automatically for every product in the list.
- **Objective:** For the currently focused TV product card, extract specific fields such as Name, Price, and Rating.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Data Field Examples:** (Adjust based on the actual page)
    - **Product Name:** The title of the product.
    - **Price:** The current selling price.
    - **Rating:** User rating (if available on the page).
  - **Filtering Criteria:** Leave unchecked (unless you have specific filtering needs).
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task**.

> **Effect:** Every time the Loop List moves to a new product card, it triggers this **Extract Data Item** node to append that product's info to the result set.

### 4. Finish: Output Data (Export All Products)

- **Objective:** Once the Loop List finishes traversal (reaching the "Max items" count or when no new products appear), compile all collected records into structured data.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Output Format:** Select **CSV** (for Excel/Spreadsheets) or **JSON** (for API/Developers).
  - **Output as a file:** Check this if you want a direct download. Uncheck if you only need the data in the logs/API response.
  - **In Abnormal Situation:** Keep **Stop Task**.

## 3. Human Operation vs. AI Nodes

To better understand the workflow, compare how a human operates versus how the AI nodes are structured.

| **Your Action (Human Operation)**                                | **Corresponding AI Node**                  | **Function Description**                                                      |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open** Crutchfield's TV list page.                             | **Visit Page**                             | Opens the target list directly, skipping homepage navigation.                 |
| **Browse** the list from top to bottom.                          | **Loop List**                              | Locks onto the product list area and traverses items sequentially.            |
| **Look** at the current product and copy Name, Price, Rating.    | **Extract Data Item** (Child of Loop List) | Extracts fields from the currently focused card and adds them to the results. |
| **Scroll** to the bottom, see "Load More," and click it.         | **Loop List** (Built-in Auto-click)        | Automatically detects and clicks "Load More" to append items.                 |
| **Continue** scrolling and copying new items as they appear.     | **Loop List** (Driver)                     | Drives the "Expand + Traverse" process within the same page.                  |
| **Stop** when enough items are collected, and organize the list. | **Finish: Output Data**                    | Exports all collected results (CSV/JSON).                                     |

## 4. Summary

Whenever you encounter a **"Load More / Infinite Scroll"** multi-page list with the characteristic: **"The page doesn't change, but clicking 'Load More' or scrolling down appends more content,"** you can directly apply this Case 3 pattern:

1. Use **Loop List** to lock the list region.
2. Check the **Auto-click Load More** option.
3. Place an **Extract Data Item** node inside the Loop List.
4. Use **Finish: Output Data** to export the results.

This ensures a stable, automatic scraping process for all "single-page expansion" lists.
