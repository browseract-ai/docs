Overview

The Scroll to Element node automatically scrolls the page until a target area or element appears in the viewport. It is suitable for scenarios where you "know where to go, but don't know how much to scroll."

**Use Cases**

- Scrolling to the comment section on YouTube, Instagram, or forums.
- Scrolling to a specific "Job List Area" or "Product Review Area" in the middle of a page.
- Scrolling to specific areas like "Form Bottom" or "Footer Subscription Area" on long pages.

**Core Capabilities**

- Locates target areas based on natural language descriptions.
- Automatically scrolls up to approximately 10 screens until the element appears in the visible area.
- Supports target area selection on pages with multiple scrollable regions.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Scroll to Element** node.
2. Describe the target element/area in the description field, for example:
   - "Comment section"
   - "The job list area in the middle of the page"
   - "The newsletter subscription form at the bottom"
3. If the page has multiple scrollable areas:
   - Check **Page has multiple scrollable areas**.
   - Describe the specific area to scroll (e.g., "Main content area", "Comment area").
4. Configure the maximum scroll attempts (default is roughly 10 screens).
5. At runtime, the node scrolls screen by screen until the target area is located, then executes subsequent nodes.

**Recommendations**

- Descriptions should target the "Area" rather than an action, for example:
  - ✅ "Scroll to the comment section"
  - ❌ "Scroll down until you see the button"
- If you need to click or extract data after scrolling, place [**Click Element**](/learn/basics/node-types/click-element-node) / [**Extract Data**](/learn/basics/node-types/extract-data-node) after this node.
- For complex page structures, verify the relative position of the area in a browser before writing the description.
