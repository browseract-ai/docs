Overview

The Wait node inserts a "waiting period" into the workflow to ensure pages or dynamic content have finished loading before subsequent operations are executed, preventing clicks or extractions from failing due to slow loading.

**Use Cases**

- Waiting for content to load after clicking "Load More" or "View More Comments."
- Waiting for a new page to render after switching pages or submitting forms.
- Pages with heavy JavaScript or significant network latency.

**Core Capabilities**

- Pauses the workflow for a specified number of seconds (e.g., 3s, 5s, 10s).
- Can be used as a pacing tool between any nodes.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Wait** node.
2. Enter the number of seconds in **Wait Time**, for example:
   - **3 seconds:** Fast-loading pages.
   - **5 seconds:** General dynamic pages.
   - **10 seconds:** Complex or slow pages.
3. At runtime, the workflow pauses at this node for the corresponding duration, then proceeds to the next node.

**Recommendations**

- Recommended for use after nodes that trigger page changes, such as [**Click Element**](/learn/basics/node-types/click-element-node), [**Visit Page**](/learn/basics/node-types/visit-node), [**Pagination**](/learn/basics/node-types/pagination-node), or [**Scroll**](/learn/basics/node-types/scroll-page-node).
- Wait times should be "sufficient but not excessive"; optimize through testing.
- For pages that load in stages, use multiple shorter Wait nodes after key actions instead of one long wait.
- **Note:** Wait cannot replace element detection logic; it is merely a time compensation measure.
