## What is BrowserAct MCP Server?

BrowserAct **MCP Server** is a standardized service that lets **MCP Clients** interact with the BrowserAct platform through the [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). With it, MCP Clients can:

- **Discover and execute** browser automation workflows as **MCP Tools**
- **Read outputs** (results, files) and access related data storage
- **Trigger real-world actions** via natural language (e.g., send messages, create tasks, update records)

### Key Features

- **Multi-Scenario Support:** Enables MCP Clients to run targeted tasks or complex searches across different applications
- **Natural Language Interaction:** Describe what you need—no complex code or commands
- **Unlimited Tool Exposure:** One MCP Server can expose unlimited **MCP Tools**
- **Multi-Client Compatibility:** Works with Claude, ChatGPT, OpenAI Agent Builder, and other MCP-compatible clients

### Use Cases

BrowserAct **MCP Tools** are a good fit when you want an **MCP Client** to:

- Automate browser operations (web scraping, form filling, navigation)
- Run repetitive tasks across multiple platforms
- Call workflows directly from a chat interface
- Turn complex workflows into simple, natural-language requests

## How to Create MCP Tools and Connect to MCP Clients

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

1. A **BrowserAct account** (sign up for free)
2. A workflow ready to convert into an **MCP Tool**
3. An **MCP Client** (e.g., Claude Desktop or ChatGPT)

---

## Part 1: Convert a Workflow into an MCP Tool

### 1) Enable MCP Configuration

- Open your target workflow in BrowserAct
- Click **MCP Configure** (top-right)
- Toggle **MCP-Ready** to **ON**

> **Important:** Turning on **MCP-Ready** does _not_ activate the tool immediately.\
> After you finish configuration, you **must publish the workflow** for the MCP Tool to take effect. MCP Clients will only run the **latest published version**.

---

### 2) Configure Basic Information

#### Tool Call Name

- **Requirements:** 2–32 characters; must start with a letter; only letters, numbers, and underscores
- **Must be unique** within your account
- **Example:** `Reddit_Scraper_Tool`

#### Description

- Explains **what the tool does** and **how the MCP Client should use it**
- **Example:** “Reddit scraper that extracts posts and comments from any subreddit. Captures titles, text, timestamps, and user details.”

#### Tool Output Method

- Choose **Text** or **File** depending on output size and how you plan to consume results

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 41 50](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-41-50.png)

---

### 3) Configure Input Parameters

Input parameters control what values are passed into the workflow when the MCP Tool is called.

**Key behavior for MCP Tools**

- Input values are stored **server-side** and are **not visible** to MCP Clients
- Once published, input parameter settings **cannot be modified** (you must update and republish)

Two supported modes:

#### Mode A: AI-Inferred

- The MCP Client fills the value at runtime based on the parameter description
- **Requirement:** Write descriptions that are explicit enough for the MCP Client to infer correctly
- **Example:** `DataLimit` → “Enter the number of data items to extract per run.”

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 42 32](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-42-32.png)

#### Mode B: Fixed Value

- Uses a constant value for every execution
- **Example:** Set `DataLimit` to `20`

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 42 55](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-42-55.png)

---

### 4) Publish (Required)

Click **Publish** (top-right) to publish the workflow.

> **Publishing is required** for MCP Tool configuration changes to become active.\
> If you only configure but don’t publish, MCP Clients will still run the **previous published version** (or won’t see the tool at all, depending on exposure).

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 43 19](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-43-19.png)

---

## Part 2: Create an MCP Server and Expose MCP Tools

### 1) Navigate to MCP Server Settings

You can access this in either way:

- From the publish success popup: click **Expose on MCP Server**
- From the Dashboard: click **MCP Servers**

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 44 08](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-44-08.png)

---

### 2) Add an MCP Server

1. Click **\+ Add**
2. **Server Name:** e.g., `Server-20251217-01`
3. **Description (optional):** e.g., `Social Media Automation`
4. Click **Confirm**

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 44 35](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-44-35.png)

---

### 3) Expose MCP Tools

1. In the MCP Server list, select your target **MCP Server** and click **Management**
2. Go to **Exposed Tools** → **Not Exposed**
3. Select the **MCP Tools** you want to expose and click **Expose**
4. Click **Confirm**

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 45 18](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-45-18.png)

---

## Part 3: Connect an MCP Server to MCP Clients

Each MCP Server has a unique **MCP Server URL** and **API Key**. You need the **matching pair** to connect an MCP Client.

### 1) Retrieve MCP Server URL and API Key

1. In the MCP Server list, select the target server and click **Management**
2. Open **Connect to Clients**
3. Copy the **MCP Server URL**
4. Click **Create New API Key**, then copy the key

![Pix Pin 2025 12 18 11 46 09](/images/PixPin_2025-12-18_11-46-09.png)

---

### 2) Configure the MCP Client

1. Select your **MCP Client** (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT)
2. Click the client icon to view setup instructions
3. Follow the instructions to update the client configuration

_Note: If your MCP Client is not listed, follow its documentation for adding a generic MCP Server._

---

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Client shows an authentication error

- Confirm the **API Key** is correct
- Verify the key in **Management → Connect to Clients**
- Ensure the key hasn’t been deleted/revoked

### MCP Client can’t find MCP Tools

- Confirm the **MCP Server URL** is correct
- Ensure the **MCP Server** is online
- Confirm at least one MCP Tool is **exposed** on the MCP Server
- Confirm the workflow has **MCP-Ready** enabled
- Confirm the workflow has been **published** (unpublished changes do not apply)

### MCP Client can’t execute operations

- Check BrowserAct account credits
- Confirm the tool is correctly configured and exposed on the MCP Server
- Improve tool descriptions if the MCP Client fails to trigger it reliably
- Check whether usage limits have been reached

### Execution issues (no response / long delays)

- Execution time depends on workflow complexity
- Check **Execution Logs** in MCP Server management for status and error details

## FAQ

**1. Can all workflows be converted into MCP Tools?**\
Yes—except workflows that require manual credential input for each run.

**2. How many MCP Servers can a user create?**

- **Free users:** 1 MCP Server
- **Paid users:** Unlimited MCP Servers

**3. How many MCP Tools can be exposed per MCP Server?**\
No limit. One MCP Server can expose unlimited MCP Tools.

**4. Can input parameters be modified after configuration?**\
No. After publishing, parameters are fixed. To change them, update the workflow and publish a new version.

**5. Does an offline MCP Server affect MCP Client connections?**\
Yes. MCP Clients cannot connect or execute tools while the MCP Server is offline (exposure settings remain saved).

**6. Do API Keys expire?**\
Not by default. Keys can be manually revoked or regenerated in MCP Server management.

**7. Where can I view execution results?**\
In the MCP Server list, open **Management** for the server to view logs, execution time, and error details.

**8. Do MCP Tools sync automatically when a workflow is updated?**\
Yes—**after you publish**. MCP Tools always run the **latest published version**. If you only edit configuration without publishing, MCP Clients will continue using the previous published version.
