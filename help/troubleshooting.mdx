### Extracted No Data

**Quick Diagnostics & Solutions:**

**1.Data** **Outside Visible Area**

**Issue:** "Extract from visible area" is enabled, but the target data is below the fold or requires scrolling **Solution:** Add a "Scroll" action before extraction to bring the data into view

---

**2.Data** **on Different Page**

**Issue:** Target data is on a detail page, but you're currently on the listing page **Solution:** Add a "Click" action to navigate to the detail page before extracting

---

**3.Wrong Extraction Node Used**

**Issue:** Used `Extract Data Item` when extracting page-level data **Solution:**

- scraping a full page or capturing all items at once → **Extract Data** Inside Loop List → **Extract Data Item**

---

**4.Data** **Not Fully Loaded**

**Issue:** Page uses dynamic loading; data shows "Loading..." when extraction runs **Solution:** Add a "Wait" action for 2-5 seconds before extraction

---

**Login Required**

**Issue:** Data is hidden or shows "Please log in" message for unauthenticated users **Solution:** Add login steps at the beginning of your workflow

### Best Practice: Configure Login Flow

**Recommended approach:**

Use a **Conditional Node:**

```
1. Visit website
2. Conditional: "Is login button visible?"
   ├─ YES → Click login → Use credentials → Log in
   └─ NO → Skip to business logic
3. Continue workflow
```

This handles:

- Optional login sites
- Already-logged-in sessions
- Dynamic login flows
