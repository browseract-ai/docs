### **2. Choose Browser Mode**

Select how BrowserAct manages browser data and sessions for your workflow.

#### **Standard Browser（ Default）**

**Persistent browser sessions** across runs

Each workflow gets a **dedicated and stable browser environment**

Cookies, cache, and login state are automatically preserved

**Best for**

- Logged-in accounts
- Long-running automation tasks

#### **Private Browser**

Use **Private Browser** only if:

- You are scraping public pages
- Logging is not required
- Each run should start with a clean environment

Private Browser runs in incognito mode and does not save any data after execution.

### **3. Configure Proxy**

BrowserAct supports **two proxy options**, allowing you to control IP location and network identity.

- **BrowserAct Proxy:**

**Fastest and easiest option**

- Built-in **global residential proxy network**
- Automatically assigns a new IP on each run
- Select a country or region directly — no manual setup required

**Custom Proxy:**

Use this only if you already have your own proxy service.

- Add your preferred HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy
- Supports authentication and custom endpoints
- Includes **Proxy Check** to validate connectivity before running tasks
