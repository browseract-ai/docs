#### 1.Standard Browser

- **Positioning**  Designed to simulate **long-term, stable real-user behavior**.
- **How it works**

Each workflow is assigned a **fixed Browser ID**

Cookies, cache, and browsing history are automatically stored

The same browser environment is reused across runs

- Use **Standard Browser** when:
- **Your workflow requires logging into an account and staying logged in**  (e.g. dashboards, admin panels, social platforms)
- **The same workflow runs  repeatedly over time**  (daily, weekly, or event-triggered automation)
- **You want websites to see a consistent, returning user**  instead of a new visitor on every run
- **Session stability matters more than anonymity**  (fewer re-logins, fewer verification prompts)

**Not recommended for**

- High-frequency account switching
- Strong anonymity or one-off scraping tasks

#### 2.Private Browser

- **Positioning**  Designed for **fully isolated, temporary browser environments**.
- **How it works**

Each run starts with a clean browser instance

No cookies, cache, or browsing history are saved

Browser data is destroyed after the task completes

Use **Private Browser** when:

- **You are scraping or browsing public pages without login**  (search results, product listings, content pages)
- **Each run should be fully isolated from previous runs**  (no cookies, no session reuse)
- You want to avoid cross-session tracking or data accumulation
- You are testing multiple scenarios where persistence is unnecessary

**⚠️ Switching Reminder**: When switching from Standard Mode to Private Mode, the system will prompt: **"Historical browser data will be cleared."**
