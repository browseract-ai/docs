## 1. Eligibility

Credit Packs are designed as supplementary resources for our active users. To purchase a Credit Pack, you must meet one of the following conditions:

- You have an **active subscription** (Monthly or Yearly Plan).
- You are a **Lifetime Deal (LTD)** holder.

_Note: Credit Packs are not available for users on the Free Plan._

## 2. Expiration & Reset Policy (Important!)

All credits from a Credit Pack are **strictly tied to your current Monthly Cycle.**

- **The Rule:** All credits from a Credit Pack **expire and reset to zero** at the end of your current monthly cycle. They do **not** roll over to the next month.
- **Synchronization:** Regardless of whether you are on a Monthly or Yearly plan, the expiration date of your Credit Pack is exactly the same as your next **monthly credit reset date**.

> #### ⚠️ Critical Example:
>
> If your current monthly cycle is set to reset on **Jan 15th**:
>
> - If you buy a Credit Pack on **Jan 1st**, you have 14 days to use those credits.
> - If you buy a Credit Pack on **Jan 14th**, those credits will **expire in 24 hours** on Jan 15th.

## 3. Double Confirmation

To prevent accidental purchases or misunderstandings regarding the expiration date:

- A **confirmation pop-up** will appear before you complete your purchase.
- This pop-up will explicitly state the expiration date of the credits you are about to buy. Please review this information carefully before proceeding.

4. Refund Policy

All Credit Pack purchases are **final and non-refundable**, regardless of whether the credits were used before the monthly cycle reset.
