## 1. Choosing Your Plan

We offer two billing cycles to suit your needs:

- **Monthly Subscription: **Full flexibility, billed on a recurring monthly basis.
- **Yearly Subscription:** Best value, billed annually (Includes a 20% discount compared to monthly billing).

> **Note:** All prices are billed in USD.

## 2. Credit Allocation & Reset Policy

To ensure a consistent experience, credits are distributed based on your **Monthly Billing Cycle**, regardless of whether you are on a Monthly or Yearly plan.

- **Distribution:** Credits are automatically added to your account at the start of each billing month.
- **No Roll-over Policy:** All unused credits **expire at the end of each billing cycle** and do not roll over to the next month.
- **Reset Logic:** Your credits reset on the same date each month.
  - **Example:** If you subscribed on **Jan 15th**, your current cycle ends on **Feb 14th at 23:59:59 (UTC)**. Your new credits will be issued, and the previous balance will reset, on **Feb 15th at 00:00:00 (UTC)**.

## 3. Managing Your Subscription

You have full control over your subscription through your dashboard.

#### How to Cancel

If you wish to stop your subscription, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Plan & Billing**.
2. Go to the **Subscription** section.
3. Click **Cancel Subscription** and follow the confirmation prompts.

#### What happens after I cancel?

- **Current Benefits:** You will retain access to all features and your remaining credits until the **end of your current billing cycle**.
- **Auto-Renewal:** Your subscription will not renew once the current period expires.
- **Account Status:** After the cycle ends, your account will automatically revert to the Free Tier.

## 4. Refund Policy

Please note that all subscription payments are **non-refundable**. We recommend exploring our Free Plan or starting with a Monthly Plan to ensure our service meets your requirements before committing to a longer term.
