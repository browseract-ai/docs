## 1. Upgrade Options & Timing

We offer two ways to upgrade your plan depending on when you want the new benefits to start:

#### Option A: Immediate Upgrade

- **Availability:** This option is available if there are **more than 48 hours remaining** in your current billing month.
- **How it works:** Your new features and the credit difference are unlocked **instantly**.
- **Billing:** You pay the **fixed price difference** between your current plan and the new plan.
- **Cycle Rule:** Your original billing cycle remains unchanged.

#### Option B: Next Cycle Upgrade

- **Availability:** Available at any time during your subscription. (Note: If you are within **48 hours** of your billing cycle end date, this is the only available option).
- **How it works:** You continue with your current plan until the end of the current cycle. The new plan and its full credits will activate automatically on your **next billing date**.
- **Billing:** You will be charged the **full price** of the new plan immediately to schedule the upcoming cycle.

## 2. Cost & Credit Examples

#### Example: Immediate Upgrade

If you are currently on a **\$10/month** plan (100 credits) and upgrade to a **\$30/month** plan (500 credits):

- **Payment:** You pay a flat difference of **\$20** immediately.
- **Credits:** You receive the difference of **400 credits** instantly.
- **Cycle:** If your cycle was set to end on the 15th, it **remains the 15th**. You do not get a "fresh month"; you simply boost your current month's capacity.

#### Example: Next Cycle Upgrade

If you choose to have the **\$30/month** plan start from the next period:

- **Payment:** You pay **\$30** today.
- **Activation:** You stay on your \$10 plan for the rest of this cycle. On your next billing date, your account will refresh with the full 500 credits of the new plan.

## 3. Switching from Monthly to Yearly

Directly switching from a Monthly plan to a Yearly plan is not supported at this time.

**To switch to a Yearly plan:**

1. Navigate to **Plan & Billing** and **Cancel** your current Monthly subscription.
2. Once canceled, you can immediately select and purchase a **Yearly Plan**.
3. **Activation:** The Yearly Plan will be scheduled to start automatically **at the beginning of your next billing cycle**, ensuring no interruption to your service.
