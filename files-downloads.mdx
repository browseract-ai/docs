title: "Files & Downloads"
---

The **Download** feature allows BrowserAct workflows to automatically download files from web pages during execution.

It works by triggering download actions through interaction nodes, enabling automated file collection without manual steps.

## What Is Download

Files can be downloaded automatically during workflow execution whenever the workflow interacts with page elements that trigger a download.

Downloads are supported in common interaction steps such as:

- Click Element
- Click Element Item
- Visit Page
- Go Back Tab
- Human Interaction

As long as a page contains a visible and clickable download button or link, the workflow can capture and download the file as part of the run.

## What You Can Do

Use Download to automate file collection from websites, such as:

- Image downloads
- Music and video downloads
- PDF and document downloads
- Dataset and resource downloads
- Bulk content retrieval from listing pages

## Supported Files

BrowserAct supports downloading any file format available on the page.

Examples include:

- Images
- Audio files
- Documents
- Archives
- Other downloadable resources

## Limits

To ensure stable workflow execution, the following limits apply:

**File size**

- Maximum size per file: 50 MB

**Download quantity**

- Maximum downloads per workflow run: 100 files

**Availability**

- Download tasks remain available for up to 30 minutes after workflow execution

**Retention**

- Downloaded files are stored for 7 days
- Files expire automatically after the retention period

## Supported Scenarios

Download works when:

- A page contains a visible download button
- Clicking triggers a direct file download

Currently not supported:

- Hover-triggered download buttons
- Hidden download actions without clickable elements

## Best Practices

- Use visible download buttons
- **Add wait steps after triggering downloads**
- Use looplist for batch downloading
- Avoid hover-only download interactions

## FAQ

### Why didn’t the download start?

Possible reasons:

- The download button is not directly clickable
- The button requires hover interaction
- A pop-up or login is blocking the download
- The file exceeds the size limit

Try:

- Using Click Element Item
- Adding a Wait step
- Checking workflow logs

### Why can’t I find my downloaded file?

- Files are stored in **Browser Download**
- Download tasks remain available for 30 minutes after execution
- Files expire in 7 days

### Can I download files that require login?

Yes.

If the workflow includes login steps and the session remains active, downloads will work normally.

### Does BrowserAct support PDF / video / zip downloads?

Yes. Any file format that can be downloaded directly from a webpage is supported.

### **Why should I add a Wait step after triggering a download?**

If multiple download actions are triggered too quickly, the previous request may not finish before a new one starts.  When this happens, the system may prioritize the latest request, which can result in only the most recent file being saved.

Adding a Wait step after each download action gives the system enough time to complete the current download request and improves overall download reliability.

# Integration with Workflows

Download works as part of workflow execution and integrates with:

### Workflow automation

- Trigger downloads via interaction nodes
- Run batch downloads via loops

### Data pipelines

- Combine downloads with scraping workflows
- Automate file collection + data extraction

### Storage & processing

- Download files first, then process them via workflows
- Integrate with downstream automation steps

Download functionality enables workflows to retrieve files directly from websites through interactive steps. It eliminates the need for manual file collection and downloading.
