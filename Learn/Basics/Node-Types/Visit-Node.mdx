Overview

The Visit Page node is used to open a target webpage in the browser and serves as the starting point for most browser automation workflows. You can specify a URL to load in either the current tab or a new tab, laying the foundation for subsequent clicks, inputs, scrolling, and data extraction.

**Use Cases**

- Initiating any web data scraping process (product list pages, search result pages, forum lists, etc.).
- Starting e-commerce price monitoring or content monitoring tasks.
- Serving as the entry point for a workflow, followed by actions like clicking, inputting, or scrolling.

**Core Capabilities**

- Opens a specified URL in the current tab or a new tab.
- Supports dynamic URL generation using parameters (variables).
- Configurable exception handling (e.g., terminate the task if the page fails to open).

**Configuration Steps**

1. Click **\+** in the workflow and select the **Visit Page** node.
2. In the **URL** input field:
   - Directly enter or paste a complete URL (must start with `http://` or `https://`), e.g., `https://www.browseract.com/`.
   - Enter `/` to reference variables output by preceding nodes (e.g., `{{target_url}}`) for dynamic navigation.
3. Select the access mode:
   - **Current Tab Access:** Open the page in the active tab.
   - **New Tab Execution:** Open the page in a new tab to maintain environment isolation.
4. Configure exception handling as needed:
   - Set to **Stop Task** if access fails or loading fails.

**Recommendations**

- Each Visit Page node should only be responsible for "opening one page"; do not mix in actions like clicking or scrolling.
- It is generally recommended to place the Visit Page node after the **Start** node and before all interaction nodes.
- For batch tasks (multiple URL lists), it is recommended to combine this with parameters and Loop nodes.
- Before running officially, test the URL in a standard browser to ensure it opens correctly.
