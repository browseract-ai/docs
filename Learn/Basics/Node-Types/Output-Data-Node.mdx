Overview

The Output Data node is the "closing node" of a workflow. It is specifically used to aggregate the results from all preceding [Extract Data](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Extract-Data-Node) / [Extract Data Item](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Extract-Data-Item-Node) nodes and export them into a specified data format.

**Use Cases**

- Exporting collection results to CSV for Excel / Google Sheets analysis.
- Exporting JSON for consumption by other systems or APIs.
- Exporting Markdown for manual review or reporting.

**Core Capabilities**

- Aggregates all structured data outputs generated during workflow execution.
- Supports multiple export formats: JSON, CSV, XML, Markdown.
- Supports downloading results as a file.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add an **Output Data** node at the end of the workflow (Note: There can be only one, and it must be the last node).
2. Select the output format:
   - **JSON:** Suitable for integrated systems, APIs, automation platforms.
   - **CSV:** Suitable for spreadsheet analysis.
   - **XML:** Suitable for traditional enterprise systems or standardized data exchange.
   - **Markdown (MD):** Suitable for generating readable reports.
3. If a direct file download is required, check the **Output as file** option.
4. After the workflow completes, the output node will provide a download link or viewable result.

**Recommendations**

- Ensure there is at least one [Extract Data](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Extract-Data-Node) / [Extract Data Item](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Extract-Data-Item-Node) node before Output Data; otherwise, the output will be empty.
- If multiple different export formats are needed, convert formats via external tools; keep one Output Data node within the workflow.
- When connecting to automation platforms (like Make, n8n), prioritize the JSON format.
