title: "Loop List Node"
description: "Iterates through a specific list area on the page to process items (extract data or click) one by one."

Overview

The Loop List node is used to iterate through every item in a specific "list area" on a page (e.g., job lists, product lists, post lists) and perform child operations (extract, click, etc.) on each item.

**Use Cases**

- Batch extracting data from Reddit posts, product cards, job cards, etc.
- Entering the detail page of each item in a list to collect more detailed information.
- Performing the same operation (click, scroll, scrape) on every element in a list.

**Core Capabilities**

- Locates list regions via natural language description.
- Supports setting a maximum number of loop items (**Max Focused Loop Items**).
- Supports a **Load More** option for lists requiring expansion.
- Supports up to 3 levels of nested Loop Lists for complex multi-level lists.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Loop List** node.
2. Configure basic settings:
   - **List Region Description:** Describe where the list is located, e.g., "The job list area in the middle of the page."
   - **Load More:**
     - Check: If the list requires clicking "Load More" or uses pagination.
     - Uncheck: If the list auto-loads or only the current page is needed.
   - **Max Focused Loop Items:** Maximum number of items to process (e.g., 10, 20, 50), set according to business needs.
3. Add child nodes inside the Loop List:
   - **Extract Data Item:** Extract fields from the current list item.
   - **Click Element Item:** Click a button or link within the current list item.

**Recommendations**

- Only one Loop List node is allowed per hierarchy level; maximum 3 levels of nesting.
- Loop List requires at least one child node (**Extract Data Item** or **Click Element Item**).
- Setting **Max Focused Loop Items** too high may result in excessive execution time; match it to actual requirements.
- For infinite scroll lists, combine with **Scroll** nodes and the "Load More" option.
