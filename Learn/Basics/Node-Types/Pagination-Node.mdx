Overview

The Pagination node is used to automatically turn pages in multi-page content, such as clicking "Next Page" or "Previous Page" buttons. It works with extraction nodes to implement batch collection across multiple pages.

**Use Cases**

- Multi-page search results or product lists on e-commerce sites.
- Multi-page job lists on recruitment sites.
- Paginated archive lists on news sites or forums.

**Core Capabilities**

- Supports **Next Page** or **Previous Page** navigation.
- Can generate multi-page loops when combined with Extract Data, Loop List, Loop, and Scroll nodes.
- Option to terminate the task or skip and continue upon pagination failure.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Pagination** node.
2. Select the direction in **Direction**:
   - **Next Page**
   - **Previous Page**
3. Configure error handling strategy:
   - **Stop Task:** Terminate the workflow if pagination fails (e.g., reached the last page).
   - **Skip and Continue:** Ignore the current pagination error and proceed to subsequent nodes.
4. Usually place Pagination after **Extract Data** to ensure current page data is collected before turning the page.

**Recommendations**

- Each Pagination node executes only one page turn action. For batch pagination, combine with **Loop** / **Loop List**.
- If the pagination button is not in the current visible area, use **Scroll Page** or **Scroll to Element** first to scroll to the pagination area.
- For scenarios with an uncertain number of pages, recommend using **Loop** with "Data count/Button status" as the exit condition.
