Overview

The Click Element node is used to simulate user click operations on a page. You simply describe the element you want to click (button, link, icon, etc.) using natural language, and the system will automatically locate and click it.

**Use Cases**

- Clicking buttons like "Login," "Search," "Next Page," or "Submit."
- Triggering searches, submitting forms, expanding content, or opening pop-ups.
- Navigating pages via navigation menus or pagination.

**Core Capabilities**

- Locates target elements within the current visible area based on natural language descriptions.
- Simulates real user clicking behavior to trigger page navigation or events.
- Supports exception handling (how to proceed if the element is not found or cannot be clicked).

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Click Element** node to the workflow.
2. In **Element Description**, describe the target element and its position using natural language, for example:
   - ✅ "The blue Start free trial button in the top right corner of the page"
   - ✅ "The Submit button at the bottom of the form"
   - Avoid vague or compound action descriptions, such as:
     - ❌ "Click login button" (insufficient information)
     - ❌ "Click the search button, then click the confirm button" (contains multiple actions)
3. Configure exception handling:
   - If the element cannot be found or clicking fails, set to **Stop Task**.

**Recommendations**

- Try to include: Element Type + Position + Text/Color features in the description.
- Each Click Element node performs only one click. Use multiple nodes or combine with a Loop for multiple clicks.
- If the target element is not in the current visible area, use **Scroll** nodes first to bring it into view.
- It is recommended to place Click Element nodes after Visit Page, Input Text, or Scroll nodes.
