Overview

The Loop node is a general-purpose cycle engine used to repeat a specific process flow until an exit condition is met. Unlike Loop List (which iterates through list items), Loop is better suited for repeating "cross-page or cross-action" tasks, such as turning pages or scrolling + extracting.

**Use Cases**

- Repeating "[Pagination](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Pagination-Node) + [Extraction](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Extract-Data-Node)" operations across multiple pages until a target data count is reached.
- Looping "[Scroll](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Scroll-Page-Node) + [Extraction](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Extract-Data-Node)" on infinite scroll pages until "No more data" appears.
- Repeatedly clicking a "Load More" button until specific text appears or a condition is met.

**Core Capabilities**

- Supports natural language descriptions for exit conditions (e.g., "Until 50 items are collected").
- Supports setting a maximum iteration count (default 10, max 999) to prevent infinite loops.
- Supports selecting condition check timing (Before Loop / After Loop).
- Supports choosing "Stop Task" or "Skip Current Loop" on errors.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Loop** node.
2. Configure the exit condition description, for example:
   - "Until the collected product count reaches item_limit"
   - "Stop when the text 'No more results' appears at the bottom of the page"
3. Set **Max Iterations** (e.g., 10, 20) as a safety cap.
4. Select check timing:
   - **Before Loop:** Check condition before execution; if met, the loop body is not executed.
   - **After Loop:** Execute the loop at least once, then check if it should continue.
5. Add child nodes inside the Loop (such as Scroll, Extract Data, Pagination, etc.) to form the loop body.

**Recommendations**

- Prioritize clear, determinable exit conditions. Avoid vague descriptions like "Until all data is scraped."
- During development and debugging, set specific Max Iterations low (e.g., 2) to test workflow correctness before scaling up.
- Loop is oriented towards controlling "action-level repetition," whereas item-by-item processing is better handled by [**Loop List**](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Loop-List-Node).
