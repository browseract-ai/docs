Overview

Click Element Item is a specialized child node designed for use inside a Loop List. It is used to click a specific element within the current list item, such as clicking a title to enter a detail page or clicking a "View Details" button.

**Use Cases**

- Clicking video titles one by one in a video list to enter detail pages for further data collection.
- Clicking every news headline in a news list to scrape the full article content.
- Clicking product images or titles in a product list to get more specifications or reviews.

**Core Capabilities**

- Locates click targets within the currently focused list item using natural language.
- Triggers page navigation or content expansion.
- Supports continuing with **Extract Data** or other operations after clicking.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Click Element Item** node inside a **Loop List**.
2. Describe the element to click in **Element Description**, for example:
   - "Click the title link of the current job item"
   - "Click the thumbnail of the current video item"
   - "Click the View Details button in the current product item"
3. After clicking, you can attach **Extract Data** or other nodes within the same loop to complete scraping on the detail page.

**Recommendations**

- Click Element Item can only be used within a Loop List; it cannot be used independently.
- Each node clicks only once. If multiple elements need clicking, chain multiple Click Element Item nodes within the Loop List.
- Emphasize "Current Item" in the description to avoid accidentally clicking other areas of the page.
- For scenarios requiring return to the list page after navigation, combine with **Tab Operation** or **Go Back** actions.
