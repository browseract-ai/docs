Overview

The Tab Operation node manages browser tabs within an automation process, such as closing the current tab or navigating back to the previous page. This helps keep the browsing context clean and controllable in multi-page, multi-step scenarios.

Note: Current documentation primarily covers Close Tab and Go Back operations.

**Use Cases**

- After entering multiple detail pages from a list page, closing the detail page upon completion to return to the list page for further processing.
- After clicking multiple links in the same tab, needing to go back to the previous page to continue the flow.
- Performing session cleanup in complex workflows to avoid opening too many tabs.

**Core Capabilities**

- **Close Tab:** Closes the current tab (if it is the only tab remaining, it jumps to a blank page).
- **Go Back:** Navigates back to the previous page in the browsing history within the current tab.
- Supports error handling: Select Stop or Skip if history is empty or the tab is unavailable.

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Tab Operation** node and select the required operation type:
   - **Close Tab**
   - **Go Back**
2. Briefly describe the operation purpose (optional), for example:
   - "Close current detail page"
   - "Return to the job list on the previous page"
3. Configure error handling method:
   - **Stop Task:** Terminate the task when the operation cannot be executed (e.g., no history to go back to).
   - **Skip:** Ignore the error and continue executing subsequent nodes.

**Recommendations**

- In **Loop List + Click Element Item** scenarios, a common pattern is:
  - List Click → Detail Page Extraction → **Go Back / Close Tab** → Continue to next item.
- If using multi-tab mode (Visit Page selects New Tab), use Close Tab to close specific tabs after processing to remove clutter.
- Note that Tab Operation actions only affect tabs within the current session; they do not affect other browser windows on the user's local machine.
