Overview

The Extract Data node is used to extract structured data from the entire page or the current visible area. It is a general-purpose page data collection tool. Unlike Extract Data Item, it does not rely on Loop List and can be used independently.

**Use Cases**

- Extracting all matching data from a full page at once (e.g., comment lists, article lists, product info).
- Extracting a set of fields from a detail page (e.g., multiple specification fields on a product detail page).
- Accumulating data from multiple pages when combined with [Pagination](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Pagination-Node) inside a [Loop](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Loop-Node).

**Core Capabilities**

- Supports two extraction scopes: **Full Page** or **Visible Area**.
- Uses natural language to describe fields and positions to extract.
- Supports filtering conditions (filter by time, quantity, attributes, etc.).
- Can output formats like JSON, CSV, XML, Markdown (via Output Data node).

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add an **Extract Data** node.
2. Select extraction scope:
   - **Full Page:** Collect data from the entire page.
   - **Visible Area:** Collect data only from the current viewport.
3. Clearly specify content to extract in the field description. For example:
   - "Extract from product detail page: Product Name, Current Price, Original Price, Stock Status, Rating, Review Count, Seller Name, Shipping Info."
4. (Optional) Configure filtering criteria, for example:
   - "Only keep reviews from the last 30 days."
   - "Only extract products with a price greater than 100."
5. For cross-page extraction, place Extract Data inside a [Loop](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Loop-Node) or combine with [Pagination](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Pagination-Node).

**Recommendations**

- For scenarios with complex page structures, consider using multiple Extract Data nodes to process different areas separately.
- Each Extract Data node executes extraction only once. For multi-page extraction, combine with [Loop](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Loop-Node) + [Pagination](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Pagination-Node).
- Consider adding a [**Wait**](/Learn/Basics/Node-Types/Wait-Node) node before extraction to ensure dynamic content has loaded.
- Field descriptions should be detailed, including field names and meanings, to facilitate subsequent use and maintenance.
