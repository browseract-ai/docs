Overview

The Scroll Page node performs simple overall scrolling actions on the page, such as scrolling down one screen, scrolling to the top, or scrolling to the bottom, to load more content or reveal hidden areas.

**Use Cases**

- Scrolling down on long list pages to load more items.
- Scrolling to the bottom of the page to view the footer or pagination area.
- Specifying a particular area to scroll within pages that have multiple scrollable regions.

**Core Capabilities**

- Supports four basic scrolling methods:
  - Scroll down one screen
  - Scroll up one screen
  - Scroll to top page
  - Scroll to bottom page
- Supports identifying multiple scrollable areas (e.g., main content area, sidebar, etc.).

**Configuration Steps**

1. Add a **Scroll Page** node.
2. Select the scrolling direction:
   - **Scroll down one screen**
   - **Scroll up one screen**
   - **Scroll to top page**
   - **Scroll to bottom page**
3. If the page has multiple scrollable areas:
   - Check **Page has multiple scrollable areas**.
   - Specify the area in the description, such as: "Main content area", "Left sidebar", or "Comment section".
4. At runtime, the node executes one scroll action and proceeds to the next step.

**Recommendations**

- Scroll Page scrolls only once per execution. Combine with a **Loop** node for continuous scrolling.
- For pages using "Scroll down to load more," you can loop: **Scroll Page → Extract Data**.
- If the goal is to scroll to a specific area (e.g., comments section), consider using the **Scroll to Element** node instead.
