## **What is the Tab Operation Node?**

The Tab Operation Node gives you automated control over browser tabs in your workflows. It handles three core actions: closing tabs you don't need, going back to previous pages. Think of it as your automated browser navigator—keeping your sessions clean and organized while you extract data across multiple pages.

## **When Should You Use It?**

Use the Tab Operation Node if you need to:

- **Navigate between multiple pages** during data extraction (e.g., switching from a product list to individual product details)
- **Clean up browser sessions** by closing tabs after data collection
- **Return to previous pages** to continue scraping or verification
- **Manage complex workflows** that open multiple tabs and need organized navigation

## **Understanding the Three Operations**

### **1.Close Tab**

**What it does:** Closes the currently active browser tab.

**Behavior:** If only one tab remains open, executing Close Tab will navigate to a blank page instead of closing the browser entirely.

### **2.Go Back**

**What it does:** Returns to the previous page in the current tab's browsing history.

**Key behavior:** Executes navigation within the visible region's history and automatically loads the page.

## **Key Features**

- **Precise Tab Control:** Execute Close Tab, Go Back operations for accurate browser session management
- **Smart Integration:** Automatically handles tab state changes and works seamlessly with Visit Page and other nodes
- **Error Recovery:** Built-in fault tolerance with options to stop or skip when tabs are invalid, ensuring workflow stability

## **How to Set Up Tab Operation Nodes (Step by Step)**

### **Step 1: Add a Tab Operation Node**

Click the **\+** button in your workflow, then select the specific operation you need from the "Tab Operation" group:

- Close Tab
- Go Back

### **Step 2: Configure Close Tab Node**

**Operation Description:** "Close current tab"

**Error Handling:**

- **Stop Task:** Stops the workflow immediately (recommended for critical operations)
- **Skip:** Continues to the next node (useful for optional cleanup)

### **Step 3: Configure Go Back Node**

**Operation Description:** "Go back to previous tab"

**Error Handling:**

- **Stop Task:** Stops workflow if navigation history is empty
- **Skip:** Continues workflow even if back navigation fails

### 

### **Step 4: Integrate with Other Nodes**

Tab Operation nodes work best when combined with other workflow nodes:

- **After Visit Page:** Use Close Tab to clean up after visiting detail pages
- **Before Extract Data:** Use Switch Tab to navigate to the correct tab before extraction
- **After Loop List:** Use Go Back to return to the main list after processing details

## **Key Rules & Best Practices**

- **One operation per node:** Don't try to close multiple tabs with a single Close Tab node
- **Clear tab descriptions:** Be specific but flexible when describing tabs for switching
- **Error handling matters:** Always configure appropriate error behavior for your use case
- **Session awareness:** Remember that Tab Operation only works within the current browser session
