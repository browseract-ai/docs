### Prerequisites

Before you start:

- You have a **BrowserAct account**.
- In BrowserAct, you’ve gone to **Integrations → API** and created an **API Key**.
- You have this API key ready to paste into n8n / Make as a credential.

---

## Using BrowserAct in n8n

BrowserAct can be used in n8n in **two ways**:

- via the **official, verified integration**\
  – see: [BrowserAct integration on ](https://n8n.io/integrations/browseract)[n8n.io](http://n8n.io)
- via the **community node** (for self-hosted / custom deployments)\
  – see: [n8n-nodes-browseract on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-browseract)

> The configuration inside the node is the same in spirit for both options:\
> you pick a workflow, then map inputs into its parameters, and consume its outputs.

### 1. Connect n8n to BrowserAct

**Official integration**

1. In n8n, add a **BrowserAct** node to any workflow.
2. In the node’s **Credentials** section, create a new credential.
3. Paste your BrowserAct **API Key** and save.

**Community node**

1. Install the community package `n8n-nodes-browseract` into your n8n instance (follow the instructions in the npm README).
2. Restart n8n if needed.
3. Add the **BrowserAct** node provided by the community package.
4. In its **Credentials**, paste your BrowserAct API key.

### 2. Pick the workflow to run

In the BrowserAct node’s **Parameters** panel:

- Set **Resource** to `Workflow` (or the equivalent option).
- Set **Operation** to `Run a workflow`.
- Choose **Search Workflows From**:
  - `Template Marketplace` – to use a template workflow, or
  - `My Workflows` – to use a workflow you created in BrowserAct.
- In **Workflow**, select the workflow you want to run (for example `Google Maps Scraper` or any custom workflow).

### 3. Configure the input parameters

After you select a workflow, the node’s **Input Parameters** section is generated **dynamically** from that workflow’s **Start node**.

- A maps workflow might expose: `datalimit`, `URL`, `Area`, `Keyword`.
- A research workflow might expose: `target_url`, `search_keywords`, `data_limit`.
- An e-commerce workflow might expose: `asin_list`, `marketplace`, `min_price_change`, etc.

This means:

> Different workflows → different input parameter fields in n8n.\
> You don’t define these in n8n; they come from the workflow definition in BrowserAct.

Now map your data:

- Use options like **Mapping Column Mode**, **Field to match on**, and **Values to Update** (the individual parameter fields).
- Map fields from previous nodes (sheet columns, webhook fields, CRM data, etc.) into the corresponding BrowserAct parameters (`URL`, `Area`, `Keyword`, …).

### 4. Run and use the output

- Execute the BrowserAct node (or run the whole n8n workflow).
- n8n sends your mapped inputs to BrowserAct, which runs the selected workflow.
- The node returns **structured JSON items** (one item per scraped record, or whatever your workflow outputs).

You can then:

- Write the data to **Google Sheets / databases**.
- Pass it through **Routers / IF nodes** for branching logic.
- Send **emails, Slack messages, webhooks**, or trigger any other downstream process.

## Using BrowserAct in Make

BrowserAct also has an official integration in **Make**:\
[BrowserAct integration on Make](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/browser-act)

### 1. Connect Make to BrowserAct

1. In Make, add any **BrowserAct** module to your scenario.
2. In the module’s **Connection** field, create a new connection.
3. Paste your BrowserAct **API Key** and save.

### 2. Add a BrowserAct module to your scenario

1. In your scenario, insert a **BrowserAct** module.
2. Select the action **Run a workflow**.
3. Place it after the module that should provide context (for example a scheduler, Google Sheets, a webhook, etc.).

### 3. Select the workflow and inputs

In the BrowserAct module’s settings:

- **Search Workflows From**: choose `Template Marketplace` or `My Workflows`.
- **Workflow**: pick the workflow you want to run (for example `Google Scholar Research Scraper-0911`).

After you choose a workflow, the **Input Parameters** section is generated from that workflow’s **Start node**, just like in n8n:

- For example: `target_url`, `search_keywords`, `data_limit`, or any other inputs that workflow defines.

You can then:

- Enter fixed values (good for scheduled “same config every time” runs), or
- Map values from earlier modules (for example URL and keyword from a spreadsheet row or webhook payload).

### 4. Use the returned data

When the scenario runs:

- Make calls BrowserAct with the mapped parameters.
- BrowserAct executes the workflow and returns **bundles** of structured data to the next module.

You can then:

- Store the data in **Sheets / databases / Airtable / Notion**.
- Trigger **emails, Slack/Teams messages**, or create **CRM records**.
- Chain more modules to continue your business logic.

In both n8n and Make, the pattern is:

- **BrowserAct**: owns the web automation logic and defines the input parameters per workflow.
- **n8n / Make**: decide when to run that workflow, where inputs come from, and how to use the outputs in your overall automation.
