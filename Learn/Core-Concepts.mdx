These three concepts form a logical hierarchy that moves from **Design** to **Execution**:

1. **Workflow:** The **Blueprint** (The complete definition of a business process).
2. **Node:** The **Execution Unit** (The individual functional steps within the process).
3. **Task:** The **Runtime Instance** (The actual execution record of a workflow).

## 1. Workflow: The Process Blueprint

**Definition:** A Workflow is the end-to-end design of an automated process, representing a specific business goal.

In a business context, a Workflow is equivalent to a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**. It encapsulates the complete logic, rules, and sequence of actions required to achieve a desired outcome.

### From Manual Operations to Automated Workflows

Consider a typical manual routine:

> _Open e-commerce site \$\\rightarrow\$ Search for "Laptops" \$\\rightarrow\$ Iterate through 5 pages of results \$\\rightarrow\$ Extract pricing data to CSV._

In BrowserAct, this entire routine is consolidated into a single **Workflow** (e.g., named "Price Monitor"). Once saved, this workflow becomes a reusable asset. You can execute it today for "Laptops" and tomorrow for "Keyboards" using the same underlying logic.

## 2. Node: The Atomic Unit of Execution

**Definition:** A Node is a single, concrete instruction within a Workflow.

BrowserAct deconstructs complex user behaviors into granular, browser-level actions. Each component you place on the automation canvas is a **Node**.

### Mapping Manual Actions to Nodes

To automate a web task, you map your physical interactions to specific BrowserAct nodes:

| **Manual Interaction**    | **BrowserAct Node** |
| :------------------------ | :------------------ |
| Open a URL                | **Visit Page**      |
| Type text into a field    | **Input Text**      |
| Click a button or link    | **Click Element**   |
| Scroll the viewport       | **Scroll Page**     |
| Navigate to the next page | **Pagination**      |
| Copy text or data         | **Extract Data**    |
| Repeat actions for a list | **Loop**            |

**Key Distinction:** A Workflow defines **what** the business goal is, while Nodes define **how** the browser executes each step technically.

## 3. Task: The Runtime Instance

**Definition:** A Task is a single, independent execution record of a Workflow.

A Workflow is a static design file; it does not perform actions until triggered. When you initiate a "Run," BrowserAct generates a **Task**. Executing the same Workflow ten times will result in ten distinct Tasks.

### Anatomy of a Task

Every Task comprises four distinct components:

1. **Inputs:** The specific parameters defined for this run (e.g., Keyword: "Nike", Max Items: 50).
2. **Execution Log:** A chronological record of which nodes were executed, including timestamps and status codes.
3. **Output Data:** The structured result generated by the run (JSON, CSV, etc.).
4. **Resource Usage:** The computational resources (Credits) consumed to complete the operation.

## Summary

| **Concept**  | **Definition** | **Function**                                                          |
| :----------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow** | The Blueprint  | Defines the complete logic and business objective.                    |
| **Node**     | The Unit       | Represents a specific technical action (Click, Type, Scroll).         |
| **Task**     | The Instance   | Represents a single execution event with specific inputs and results. |
